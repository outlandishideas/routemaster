# Routemaster

A wordpress plugin for managing routes via url patterns rather than the built-in routing

The `master` is being kept on v1 of the plugin, to prevent projects that use the 'dev-master' version from breaking. 
All dependencies should now specify a specific version

See `v2` branch for latest changes
